HanaMinKDP toolkit.

These files are to create HanaMin Experimental version
(http://kanji-database.sourceforge.net/fonts/hanazono.html).

Please download `kage engine' from M17n CVS repository
(:pserver:anonymous@cvs.m17n.org:/cvs/chise) and prepare it
in the same directory.

Variant database from `kanji-database' can be incorporated
into `aalt' feature, but Fontforge may produce imporper font
when `aalt' entries are too large (>15,000).
